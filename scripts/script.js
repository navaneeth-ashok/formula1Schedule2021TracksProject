The layout back then incorporated a banked oval, but the rest was almost identical to the circuit we see today.</p><p>Chicanes have been added and some turns have been slightly re-profiled, but drivers of every era negotiated corners such as Curva Grande, the Lesmos and Parabolica.</p><p>And if the history wasn't enough, Monza is also the spiritual home of the tifosi, who make up one of F1's most passionate, knowledgeable crowds.</p><p>It doesn't match up to a circuit like Spa in terms of sheer beauty and challenge, but Monza is still a worthy No. 1</p>",

The roads it runs on were designed primarily for everyday traffic, with little consideration given to the sport. And it shows—the circuit is totally unsuitable for the cars of today.</p><p>There's little room for modern safety features, the straights aren't long enough and races are usually dull processions.</p><p>But it's allowed to exist simply because it's Monaco. It has glamour, prestige and (perhaps more importantly these days) everyone has heard of it, whether they know what F1 is or not.</p><p>And from a fan's point of view, when an overtake does occur, it's usually pretty special.</p>",

It was always dangerous, and as F1 moved forward the circuit was left behind. Old Spa hosted its final F1 race in 1970.</p><p>New Spa made its F1 debut in 1983. A smaller circuit, it retained famous corners such as Eau Rouge, Blanchimont and La Source while adding the quite lovely Pouhon.</p><p>Increasing downforce levels have made once-difficult corners easy, but Spa is still the best F1-standard circuit in the world.</p>",

    trackDesc : "<p>In the early days of F1, it wasn't uncommon for races to be run on public roads. Such circuits tended to be long, fast and dangerous—and the Granddaddy of the them all was the Nurburgring's Nordschleife (northern loop).</p><p>Over 22 kilometres (14 miles) in length, the Nordschleife featured jumps, banking, blind crests and 160 corners. F1 has never seen a greater test of man and machine, and it never again will.</p><p>But with the challenge and sheer size of the place also came danger. As the sport progressed into the 1970s, the risk of racing here was deemed unacceptable. Changes were made to improve safety, but they weren't (and could never have been) enough.</p><p>The German Grand Prix of 1976—in which Niki Lauda was badly burned and almost lost his life—was the last F1 race held on the Nordschleife.</p><p>In 1984 a new circuit hosted the German Grand Prix, the Nurburgring GP-Strecke. Tacked onto the southern edge of the Nordschleife, the new circuit was built to conform to modern safety standards.</p><p>It was also a little bit sterile and bland. Changes have been made over the years in an attempt to improve the spectacle and it's better than it was, but the GP-Strecke will never match up to its big brother.</p>",
